                </header>
                <p>
                    My stepmom, (Megan) and I bought food from gold belly to support the crisis currently happening in Ukraine because my stepmom owns a cyber security company that has software developers, software engineers, and designers that work for her company that live in Ukraine. Tech is in my life everyday, because I am a coder and in order to code I have to use technology to write the code somewhere and in order to see the output, I have to use tech.
